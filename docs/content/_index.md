# Description
The traditional "word count" command counts the number of bytes, lines, words, and characters in a text file.
In addition to the "word count" command, "credate" tells you the modification date of the text file.

The original plan was to display ModifyTime with the option "-d", but it is now displayed only when no options are specified or when all options except "-h" and "--help" are specified.
